# RamSetu — Organ Donor Match & Health Bridge

RamSetu is an open-source platform to improve organ donation matching and streamline health-bridge workflows between donors, patients, and clinicians. The repository contains a web application backend, frontend components, and machine-learning modules used for donor-organ matching and ranking.

Key components
- `ramsetu-health-bridge-main/`: fullstack app (server, frontend, admin tools)
- `ml_hybrid_module/`: machine-learning datasets, models, and training/prediction scripts
- `Round2/`: project materials, documentation, and deliverables for the current round

Open Innovation theme

This project follows an Open Innovation approach: we welcome contributions, experiments, and alternative models from the community. Our goals are:
- Collaborate openly on data, models, and integration patterns.
- Encourage iterative rounds of contributions where teams propose improvements, share results, and learn from each other.
- Keep the code modular so new matching algorithms, UI improvements, or research artifacts can be added with minimal friction.

Round 2 details

All details, documentation, and deliverables for this round are located in the `Round2/` folder — start there for requirements, submission notes, and assets.

How to contribute
- Fork or clone this repository and open issues or pull requests for changes.
- Follow the existing folder structure: backend changes under `ramsetu-health-bridge-main/server`, frontend under `ramsetu-health-bridge-main/src`, and ML work under `ml_hybrid_module/`.
- If you plan to add large binary assets (video/data), use an external host or Git LFS; contact maintainers before adding large files.

Contact & governance

Maintainers and contributor guidelines are in the repository docs. If you need an invite or access, open an issue or contact the maintainers via the project channels.
